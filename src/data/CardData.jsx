        The Rainbow Arching Bridge, known as 跨虹桥 (Kuà Hóng Qiáo), stands as
        the first bridge of the six bridges along the Su Di Causeway. The
        inception of this causeway can be attributed to the visionary writer, Su
        Shi, who, during his governance in Hangzhou from 1089 to 1091, directed
        the construction of this vital link. Utilizing the mud dredged from the
        lake, Su Shi orchestrated the creation of a causeway that seamlessly
        connected the northern and southern shores of the West Lake. This
        ingenious endeavor not only significantly enhanced the city's
        transportation network but also bestowed upon it a legendary and
        aesthetically captivating landmark.
